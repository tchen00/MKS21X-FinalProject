	- Today was the first day of working on the actual project. I...
		- wrote in the fields and methods from our UML into the OurCalendar class
		- wrote in the fields from our UML into the Event class
		- made a bunch of extra (unnecessary) commits during the process of learning branching
		- many of these are merges for figuring out how to update each branch
