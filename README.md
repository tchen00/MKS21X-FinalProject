## :memo: Development Logs  
### DAY 1 - Jan 3, 2019
- **Grace** :octocat:
	- wrote in the fields and methods from our UML into the OurCalendar class
	- wrote in the fields from our UML into the Event class
	- made a bunch of extra (unnecessary) commits during the process of learning branching
	- many of these are merges for figuring out how to update each branch
- **Tammy** :sleepy:
	- wrote in method templates for Event class
	- learned about README.md and the formatting (made way too many unneccessary commits)
	- learned about branching and figured out merge conflicts were a thing not to play around with
### DAY 2 - Jan 4, 2019
- **Grace** :octocat:
	- created CalendarViews class with empty methods and fields
	- wrote numberOfDays to calculate how many days from Jan 1 2019 a specific day is
	- using numberOfDays, wrote getFirstDayOfMonth (these will be useful for printing out calendars
	- tested both in temporary main in CalendarViews, debugged (will test more later on)
- **Tammy** :hatched_chick:
	- finished the template for Event class + fix changes on prototype
	- filled in all the accessors/set methods in Event class
	- played around with lanterna and the jar file
### DAY 3 - Jan 5, 2019
- **Grace** :octocat:
	- added exceptions to numberOfDays
	- wrote getFirstDayOfYear, getWeekday
	- added private method that converts number 0-6 to the weekday (will be useful in other methods as well)
	- filled in one-line get and set methods
	- deleted getFirstDayOfWeek (would not have been useful)
- **Tammy** :smile:
	- fix prototype
	-
